# This is one of the examples that would replace cut_test.go
zql: cut foo

# we would need to add support to ztest to be able to take input from files
# like we can with the script test (easy change).  otherwise, we would need
# to replicate the test vectors in each yaml file (maybe ok?)
input:
  -source: foobar.tzng

output:
  -source: foo.tzng
